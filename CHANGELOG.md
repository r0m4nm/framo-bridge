# Changelog

All notable changes to Framo Bridge will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.5] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- **Fixed missing submodules in build** - Updated build script to include all package folders (`core/`, `processing/`, `services/`, `ui/`, `utils/`) that were missing from the zip, causing "No module named 'framo_bridge.core'" error.

## [0.4.4] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- **Fixed addon installation error** - Changed package folder name from `framo-bridge` to `framo_bridge` (underscore instead of hyphen). Python module names cannot contain hyphens.

## [0.4.3] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **GLB compression now works by default** - Fixed issue where Medium compression preset appeared selected but wasn't active until manually reselected. Draco compression settings now correctly initialize to match the default Medium preset.

## [0.4.2] - 2025-11-22

### Changed
- **Renamed temp objects** - Temporary proxy objects now use `FRAMO_` prefix instead of `PROXY_`
- **Simplified update UI** - Shortened update success message in Preferences for narrow panels

## [0.4.1] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Critical crash fix** - Resolved Blender crash after export when many objects are selected
  - Root cause: Selection restoration triggered immediately after mesh data swaps caused Blender to access invalid state
  - Solution: Deferred both cleanup and selection restoration to timer callbacks that run after the operator returns
  - Export now reliably completes without crashes regardless of selection size

### Changed
- **Deferred cleanup system** - Proxy objects and temporary meshes are now cleaned up via timer callback (0.1s delay)
- **Deferred selection restore** - Original selection is restored via timer callback (0.2s delay) after cleanup completes
- **Improved state management** - All object references now stored by name to prevent stale reference issues
- **Logging improvements** - Added immediate-flush file logging to `logs/framo.log` for debugging crash scenarios

### Technical Details
- Updated `context_managers.py` - `preserve_blender_state` now uses deferred restoration
- Updated `export_service.py` - Cleanup moved to `deferred_cleanup()` timer callback
- Updated `decimation.py`, `uv_atlas.py` - Store object names instead of references for state restoration
- Silenced `clear_export_status` timer exceptions (Blender context restriction, non-critical)

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-13

### Added - UV Atlas System (New Feature)
- **Material-based UV atlas packing** - Intelligent grouping and packing system to reduce draw calls
  - Automatically groups objects sharing the same material
  - Creates optimized UV atlases using Lightmap Pack algorithm
  - Significantly improves rendering performance in game engines and WebGL
  - Smart fallback to individual unwrapping for small groups or complex cases
- **Advanced UV atlas features**
  - Configurable minimum group size threshold (default: 2 objects)
  - Adjustable atlas texture size (default: 1024px)
  - Customizable margin between UV islands (default: 0.05)
  - Preserves original objects and UV maps (non-destructive workflow)
  - Respects existing UV maps on objects
- **Comprehensive statistics and reporting**
  - Tracks atlases created and objects packed
  - Reports individual unwraps and skipped objects
  - Detailed console output with progress indicators
  - Success/failure tracking for each operation
- **Intelligent material grouping**
  - Identifies primary (most-used) material per object
  - Groups objects by shared materials automatically
  - Filters groups by minimum size threshold
  - Falls back to individual processing for small groups

### Technical Details
**New Files:**
- `uv_atlas.py` - Material-based UV atlas module (505 lines)
  - `has_uv_map()` - Check if object has UV map
  - `get_primary_material()` - Get most-used material from object
  - `group_objects_by_material()` - Group objects by shared materials
  - `create_temp_joined_mesh()` - Join objects for atlas creation
  - `apply_lightmap_pack()` - Apply Lightmap Pack UV unwrapping
  - `smart_uv_unwrap_individual()` - Fallback individual unwrapping
  - `auto_unwrap_with_atlasing()` - Main entry point with full control

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reduces draw calls by grouping objects with same material
- ✅ Optimizes UV packing for better texture utilization
- ✅ Improves WebGL and game engine performance
- ✅ Non-destructive workflow preserves original scene
- ✅ Smart fallback system handles edge cases gracefully

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-12

### Added - Subdivision Control (New Feature)
- **Individual subdivision overrides** - Advanced per-object subdivision control system
  - Global override mode with single slider (applies to all objects)
  - Individual override mode with per-object sliders (up to level 6)
  - Checkbox toggles between global and individual control
  - Smart logic: only reduces subdivision, never increases
  - Prevents accidental over-subdivision during export
- **Enhanced subdivision UI** - Professional collapsible interface
  - Summary showing count of affected objects
  - Expandable list with all objects and their settings

## [0.2.12] - 2025-01-11

### Fixed
- **Instance export bug** - Fixed issue where collection instances were not exported when selected together with mesh objects
  - When decimation or UV unwrapping was enabled, only mesh objects were being selected for export
  - Non-mesh objects (like collection instances) were deselected during temp copy creation and never re-selected
  - Now properly preserves and includes all non-mesh objects in the export selection
  - Fix ensures both mesh objects and instances are exported correctly when selected together
